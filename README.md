# EECS731_StoryTelling

Exploratory data analysis using **pie chart,histogram and wordcloud**.

Interactive visualization of clusters using **pyLDAvis**.

We are using the movielens dataset used in assignment 3. Since the dataset is too big to commit, data should be downloaded to `data` folder from http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-latest.zip

The detail documentation is included in jupyter notebook titled [Story_telling](./notebook/Story_telling.ipynb).

**Note: Since the interactive display does not work in github, please use following nbviewer link.**
